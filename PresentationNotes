===What AEC Problem Are You Solving?===

    Whether you're the landlord of a small apartment of the manager of several office buildings, you need a way to manage work orders and incidents in your facilities.

    Our product features a crowd-sourced facilities management system which provides building owners, facitilies workers, and building occupants to report, manage, and track building issues.

===Can your solution be implemented Monday===
    Our product currently features full functionality and live data.
    Technically, it could immediately be used as intended.
    The only drawback, however, is that we have not yet implemented any security or data validation, which would leave the application vulnerable to manipulation if deployed as is.

    We would like to still add additional features to our product, including push notifications, better user managment, and possibly the idea of using pins on the map to designate areas of concern.

===How much of the code was build this weekend?===
    100%
    We developed a cross-platform client-side application for mobile and web,
    and a publicly open API for data transfer.

===Technical Difficulty===
    As above - our application runs on computers, tablets, iPhone, Android, and (untested) Windows phone.

    We allow third party devices to integrate with our application - this means that you can set up smoke alarms, carbon monoxide detectors, water pressure sensors, thermostats, seismographs, circuit breakers, or security cameras to push alerts to maintenence, residents, or anyone using the app.
